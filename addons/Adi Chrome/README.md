                <br>Keyword driven testing is in the far end of the spectrum from record and play tools, as far as test automation

                    <li>Easy preference definition for the type of element locators.</li>

                        nearby element.</li>
                    <li>Automatic creation of variables based on input elements.</li>
                </ul>
